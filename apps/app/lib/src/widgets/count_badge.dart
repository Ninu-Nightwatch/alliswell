/// Extracted from the notification centre's badge (EE-077) so every counter

///
/// - **The theme's `error` / `onError` pair**, never a hand-picked red: a
///   badge is small, coloured and carries a number, which is exactly the
///   surface DESIGN §7's contrast rule exists for. The pair is measured by
///   the same gate as everything else — and it is why the text is white on
///   red in light and dark ink on a lighter red in dark: white on the dark
///   theme's `error` measures 3.22:1, under the 4.5 floor.
/// - **Zero draws nothing.** A badge that is always there stops being a
///   signal (DESIGN W8).
/// - **Beyond [max] it reads "99+".** A four-digit badge is not information,
///   it is a layout problem.
/// - **The number alone tells a screen reader nothing** about what it
///   counts, so [semanticsLabel] is required.
